# NeuronBit: CrewAI upgrade

NeuronBit is a deep learning project designed to predict the direction of Bitcoin prices. It uses a fully connected neural network (DNN) with LeakyReLU activation functions. The model is trained to determine whether the next day's Bitcoin opening price will be higher or lower than today's opening price. The project also includes a Flask web application to serve predictions.
